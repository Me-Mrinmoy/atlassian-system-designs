# System Design Interview Mastery

🎯 **Goal**  
“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” – Steve Jobs

This repository is your one-stop resource for mastering system design interviews, especially for SDE-1 and SDE-2 roles at product-based companies like Atlassian.

✅ **Objective**: Break down 20+ real-world system design problems frequently asked in high-paying tech interviews.

🎓 **Learn how to think like a systems engineer** — scalable, reliable, fault-tolerant systems.

💡 **From whiteboard to production**: Understand what trade-offs matter and how to design with scale in mind.

📈 **Make this your portfolio highlight** — a showcase of practical software architecture skills.

Whether you're preparing for interviews, building side projects, or working in production—this repo is built to level you up.
